					<h1>Four-Strategery - Strategy Game for 4-Square Users</h1>
					<h1>GAME PLAY</h1>
					<h2>Step 1 - Registration</h2>
					Use the 'Register' Link on the left side of the page to create a Four-strategery Profile
					<h2>Step 2 - Create a Game</h2>
					THIS FUNCTION IS COMMING SOON - currently you can only be added to games by administrators
					<h2>Step 3 - Play</h2>
					Once you are in a game there are basically 2 game activities:
					<ol>
						<li>Check into Venues via Four-square and Swarm - your checkins will trigger game events. See Four-square activity below</li>
						<li>Use the four-stragerey interface to move Game units between game venues to gain advantage, fight battles, and score points</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Games have a specified start and end date.</p>
					<h2>Foursquare Activity</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>When you checkin on Foursquare you will generate game activity for all active games you are a player in</li>
						<li>You are limited to 5 game checkins per game per day. The game is run on US Eastern time so if you checkin 5 times in one day any subsequent checkins will not generate
						 additional game activitys until midnight Eastern time when the count is reset for the next day.</li>
						<li>Game checkins will generate one of the following game activities
							<ul>
								<li>If the venue a player checks into is unoccupied --- Then a new unit for the checking in player will be generated in that location. The unit will be named after the venue name. The initial 
								troop strength will be based on the size of the venue (based on foursquare stats)</li>
								<li>If the venue is already occupied by the player that is checking in -- Then that unit's troops will be increased. The new troop count is determined by the same rules as when the venue is not occupied</li>
								<li>If the venue is already occupied by an opponent -- Then the checking in player receives no additional troops BUT they will receive an intelligence report which
								will provide information on the unit at that location</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Four-Strategery Game Activity</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>To move your units in Four-Strategery come to this website (Mobile app comming!(?)).</li>
						<li>Login with your creditials</li>
						<li>Use the 'Player home' link to see a list of active games (and a list of past games)</li>
						<li>Click the game name for the game you wish to view/make moves on - this will bring up the game status view</li>
					</ul>
				<h2>Game Activity View</h2>
				The game activity view is divided into several sections
				<table>
					<theader>
						<tr>
							<th>Section Name</th><th>Content</th><th>Image</th>
						</tr>
					</theader>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td><h3>Player list</h3></td>
							<td>Shows a list of players, displays the score and the number of units for each player</td>
							<td><img alt="" src="images/player_list.png">
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><h3>Game Activity</h3></td>
							<td>This is a scrollable activity list which shows all game activity in reverse chronological order. Items shown in the reddish color
							are private messages - just for you. Other items are public and are seen by all players.</td>
							<td><img alt="" src="images/activity.png" ></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><h3>Your Units</h3></td>
							<td>This section is a list of all of your current units. For each unit the list has:
							<ul>
								<li>Unit Name</li>
								<li>Current Strength</li>
								<li>Status, posible statuses are:
									<ul>
										<li>Garrisoned - means the unit in at rest in a venue</li>
										<li>In Transit - means the unit has been sent to another venue and is on the wat</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Location, this is the location the unit is in OR where it is going</li>
							</ul>
							To the right of the unit status columns there is a column with each venue in the game. These columns indicated the current occupant of each venue.
							<h3>To MOVE a UNIT: Click the cell for the venue you want to move to in that unit's row</h3>
							</td>
							<td><img alt="" src="images/your_units.png" >
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><h3>Move Distances</h3></td>
							<td>The move distances table simply shows the distances from all game venues to all others. This could be useful when planning your domination</td>
							<td><img alt="" src="images/move_distances.png" ></td>					
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
				<h2>Moving Units</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Units are moved by accessing the Game activity page for the game in question, this is done by selecting the game from the 'player home' page</li>
					<li>To move a unit</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Find the row for the desired unit in the 'Your units' list</li>
							<li>Click the column in that row for the venue you wish to move to</li>
							<li>The game will calculate the transit time required and ask you to confirm</li>
							<li>If you confirm the unit will start to move</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Once a unit is moving you cannot stop, re-route, or redirect it. It is gonna go there.</li>
					<li>All units travel at 50 miles per hour</li>
					<li>Units travel in straight lines, the most direct route, regardless of geography, roads, lakes, mountains, oceans, borders, etc</li>
					<li>Units in transit cannot interact with any other units</li>
					<li>Units in transit are not considered when scores are tabulated</li>
					<li>If a unit arrives at a venue where that player has another unit then those units merge, the troops are added together and the new unit takes the name of the
					larger of the two merged units. --- UNITS CANNOT BE UN-MERGED or split in any way.</li>
					<li>If a unit arrives at a venue occupied by a unit belonging to another player, THEN a battle will ensue......</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>BATTLES</h2>
				If a unit arrives at a venue that is occupied a battle will ensue. The rules for battles are as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>Battles end when one side or the other is annihilated - there are no tactical withdraws - more like thunderdome, one man leaves.</li>
					<li>The battle process follows the classic board game 'risk' combat system</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The Attacker gets one six sided di per 'troop' with a max of 3</li>
						<li>The Defender gets one six sided di per 'troop' with a max of 2</li>
						<li>The dice are thrown and the top di for each side are paired for comparison.</li>
						<li>The best number of the attacker is paired against the best di for the defender.</li>
						<li>If both sides have at least 2 dice then their 2nd best values are likewise paired to each other.</li>
						<li>The looser of each pairing of di looses a troop</li>
						<li>If a pairing is a tie then the defender wins</li>
						<li>This process is repeated until one side is ANNIHILATED</li>
					</ul>
					<il>The winner (what is left of them) will occupy the venue</il>
					<il>The looser's only consolation prize is that they get an accurate intelligence report on the unit that defeated them</il>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>Scoring</h2>
				The scoring system is as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>Scoring happens once per day at midnight US Eastern time</li>
					<li>Only Garrioned units participate in scoring, units in transit do not count</li>
					<li>Unit size is irrelevent when it comes to scoring</li>
					<li>Scoring works as follows</li>
					<ul>
						<li>All occupied venues are sorted by size (based on forsquare stats)</li>
						<li>Each venue provides it's occupier with points based on it's size relative to the others</li>
						<li>The occupier of the smallest venue gets 1 point for that venue</li>
						<li>The occupier of the second smallest venue gets 2 points for that venue</li>
						<li>The occupier of the third smallest venue gets 3 points for that venue</li>
						<li>and so on...</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<h2>Winning the Game</h2>
				Simple - player with the highest score when the game end date hits is the winner.
